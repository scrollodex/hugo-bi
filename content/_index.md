## Disclaimers

**All listed services are non-sexual. The professionals listed here should not receive requests for sexual services.**

As with most directories, the listing of a professional in this directory is not an indication that the professional has been personally screened or endorsed by the directory coordinator. If you feel that a professional who is listed in this directory has made inaccurate claims as to their credentials, then the directory coordinator can assist you in locating the professional board which regulates said profession, so that you can file a complaint.

This directory does not accept listings which involve sexual services, given the current illegal status of such services in the jurisdiction in which the directory is hosted.

To contact the directory coordinator, email Geri Weitzman, PhD at: geriweitzman@gmail.com
