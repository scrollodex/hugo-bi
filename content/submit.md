## Please note:

Professionals who submit their info here are expected to represent their credentials accurately.

If a user of this website feels that a professional has made false statements about the services that they are qualified to provide, then we may assist the user in locating the appropriate regulatory board to investigate the matter. Such an investigation will not automatically lead to the removal of a listing from the BAP directory - we will make an attempt to differentiate founded versus unfounded allegations, and we will use our best judgement thereafter.

This directory does not accept listings which involve sexual services, given the current illegal status of such services in the jurisdiction in which the directory is hosted.

The maintainers of this directory reserve the right to remove or refuse any directory listing for any reason.
