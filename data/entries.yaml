            I have been a psychotherapist and couples therapist since 1980 and have
            worked extensively with bisexual, lesbian, transgender, polyamorous and
            bdsm-oriented clients throughout my professional career.  My style is warm,
            open and expressive. In my work as a certified sex therapist my particular
            expertise is in the area of womens sexuality, desire disorders, and phase
            of life issues. I am a sex and relationship advice columnist for national
            magazines and a feature articles contributor.  I am currently working on my
            second book, due out in spring 2003, which focuses on female sexuality. I
            created the "Working with Polyamorous Clients in the Clinical Setting"
            workshop for sexuality professionals  (outline available at
            <A HREF="http:\www.lovethatworks.org">www.lovethatworks.org</A>). I have additional expertise in treatment related to ADD, disorders of mood, and enhancement of the creative process.  The demands of writing mean that my private practice is small and often full, but I urge
            you to inquire about availability. Feel free to make initial inquiries
            via email.

            Mine is a general psychotherapy practice in which I pay special
            attention to alternate sex and gender concerns, and to people living
            lifestyles involving those concerns. I work with adult individuals and
            couples of all identities and orientations in the leather, fetish, and
            transgender communities, and have taught, spoken, and/or published
            widely in those areas. I also work with anxiety, depression, shame,
            guilt, trust difficulties, damaged self-esteem, and inner children, any
            of which may be concerns for people who have been characterized as
            outsiders in society. Sex and gender issues frequently affect
            significant others, including romantic and erotic partners, parents,
            silblings, children, friends, colleagues, and business associates, and I
            have experience working with them as well. I am a member of the
            California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists, the Society
            for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, the American Academy of Clinical
            Sexologists, the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria
            Association, and the International Foundation for Gender Education, and
            I am a once and future member of the National Leather Association.

            The populations that I see are adolescents (my primary population), young

            (individual, couples, and group), I also perform psychological testing,
            educational evaluations, and forensic assessments and court testimony for
            these populations. Typical therapeutic issues include ADHD, LD, substance
            abuse/dependency, acting-out disorders, sport-related issues, gang and "cult"
            involvement, alternative religious expressions, alternative lifestyle issues
            (including the BDSM, gay, lesbian, and bisexual arenas), forensic matters,
            trauma survivors, and interpersonal difficulties. I am on several

            My fees are $125.00 per hour for all services in-office and $187.50 for services performed out of the office from portal to portal. Forensic services are $200.00 per hour for in-office visits and $300.00 per hour for all out of office services portal to portal.

            As a gay and lgbt-affirmative Psychologist, I provide individual,
            group and couples psychotherapy for a variety of clients.  I specialize
            in working with gay and bisexual men and women who are dealing with
            issues of sexual identity confusion, self-esteem, developing a positive
            bisexual and/or lesbian or gay identity; depression and anxiety; marital problems and marital-decision making around sexuality issues; substance abuse and addictions; sexual addiction; and recovering from childhood and/or adult sexual victimization experiences, including covert
            and overt incest, sexual assault and rape. I serve adults from ages 18-70.






            I believe that the sexual orientation of a person is their decision only,
            and it is my desire as a Psychologist to help people to feel comfortable
            and to affirm and celebrate the sexual/emotional/physical and spiritual
            connections they choose to make with the men and women in their lives. I am the Chairperson of the Ohio Psychological Associations Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered Task Force for the past 2 years, since its beginning.

            I have practiced heart-centered, body-centered, psychospiritual therapy for
            nearly two decades in the Boston Area.  I founded the Institute for
            Emotional-Kinesthetic Psychotherapy in 1990.  My interests include trauma
            work, integrating sexuality and spirituality, mentoring the soul's journey
            and creating healing community.  I have worked with gay, lesbian, bisexual
            and transgendered people for most all of my years in practice, as well as
            members of various sexual subcultures.  I am the founder of the Boston Area
            Sexuality and Spirituality Network, a staff writer for Spirituality and
            Sexuality magazine, and author of LIVING WITH VISION: RECLAIMING THE POWER OF
            THE HEART (Knowledge Systems, 1989) and HEALING THE WAR BETWEEN THE GENDERS
            (Forthcoming).  I have led workshops nationally and internationally and
            public speak on a wide variety of subjects including gender and identity,
            gender reconciliation, heart-centered healing and social evolution.





            My Degrees:  I hold a Master's Degree in Organization Development from the
            Sloan School, MIT.  I studied Psychobiology at Yale in the late 70's, prior
            to the availability of body psychotherapy training in any university setting.
             I have been a pioneer in the field of somatic psychology, helping found the
            first state professional association  in Massachusetts in 1989, helping found
            the Somatics Community within the Association for Humanistic Psychology while
            serving on the AHP Board, and through establishing a 3 year apprenticeship
            training program in Emotional-Kinesthetic Psychotherapy (EKP)--the method I
            developed and have practiced since 1985.  My school certified body-centered
            psychotherapists who completed the 1000+ hour program.

        description: |-
            Clinical Social Worker; personal and corporate coach with Arena Group Coaching & Consulting; consultant; producer of the longest-running and largest psychology-in-film series in the
            nation, <a href="http://www.psychologygoestothemovies.org">http://www.psychologygoestothemovies.org</a>, and teacher of film and pop culture theory. Also, disability activist, currently Chair of the City of Cambridge Commission for People with Disabilities.





            As a therapist, I provide individual, couple and family psychotherapy to people of all ages, cultures and nationalities; of all gender and sexual expressions; and to people with disabilities of any kind. My current case load includes Asian, African-American, and West Indian
            clients as well as European and Celtic descendants; and includes bi and gay men, lesbians and bi women, poly individuals and couples, cross-dressers and those in the BDSM D/S scene (see below)
            I work in English. I understand West Indian. My secondary office is fully accessible, but I do not have ASL or TTY.   I will work with any level of trouble or "mental illness," including people diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, psychotic illnesses, Aspergers (autism), epilepsy, etc. I also provide consultation of all kinds in psychiatry and therapy issues, second opinions, diagnostic aid, etc.  I work as covering senior clinician for many Cambridge therapists when they are away.
            Some special areas of experience include: ADD & ADHD; Evaluating and supporting people (including children and adolescents) with gender concerns, cross-dressing, and those seeking
            complete gender realignment or correction (I  am an approved provider in this speciality).
            I work with artists, actors, performers, writers, poets, and other creatives. I do pre-marital counseling upon request for couples with differences in race, class or  culture; or for couples in which one partner has a significant disability.





            As a coach, I work with *anyone who has a goal* they are determined
            and committed to achieve. I coach physicians; I coach for ICI, a program for
            women with disabilities seeking employment or career development; I coach
            novelists, screenwriters, contruction workers, nurses, etc.  The Arena
            Method® is used by coaches in my firm and has proven very dynamic -- it
            teaches clients *how to want something* in the way that ensures getting it.
            Fees for coaching are structured differently from most professional
            fees, but are roughly similar to therapy costs overall.  Clients contract
            initially for 90 days, usually including one 30-minute phone meeting per week
            (clients may be in any part of the world) and weekly structured tasks.
            Different service packages provide additional supports according to each
            plan. For the client, coaching requires guts and is a more strenuous course
            than being in therapy; it also works faster to structure current goals.

            I offer caring, compassionate support for a process that allows you to go
            deep effectively and manageably. In a relationship of safety, we will
            draw on physical, emotional, and intellectual awareness to assist growth
            and change. Through using various modalities such as meditation,
            visualization, movement, and creative expression, personal knowing and
            expansion is enhanced.





            I have worked extensively with people healing from trauma, including
            child sexual and physical abuse, and with those exploring creativity,
            sexuality, body and health issues, and spirituality. I bring a
            sensitivity to and awareness of questions of sexual and gender
            orientation. General areas of focus include self-esteem, image,
            assertiveness, and communication skills.





            What is Craniosacral Work? It is a hands-on meditative process that
            brings about change gently and non-intrusively. Craniosacral treatments
            provide energy balancing that supports our innate ability to heal. Coming
            out of osteopathic medicine, it involves gentle holding and light touch
            on the head, face, and tailbone. People report a deep sense of
            relaxation, calm, groundedness, and/or centeredness from treatments.
            Craniosacral techniques can be used in conjuncture with the
            psychotherapeutic process, where appropriate, as one method of supporting
            internal change. The client is fully clothed for the session.

            I am licensed as a psychotherapist and certified as a sex
            therapist, and my approach to counseling is more spiritual than
            traditional. I approach every client with the belief that who they are
            sexually is a part of their core, and that the issues they may have are
            usually a result of life circumstances.  In the process of working
            together, I strive to assist in the natural unfolding of who they are
            sexually. Often, sexual issues are complicated by other general issues,
            such as  relationships, communication, addictions, transitions, and
            professional concerns.




                  Over the years I have worked with many gay and bisexual people. I
            have worked too with people who have concerns about gender identity,
            transvestism,  fetish interests, sexual health and performance, aging,
            and lifestyle issues as they are related to parenting. Often, several of
            these concerns are compounded. I also coach people about Tantra, and how
            this approach to sexuality can be meaningful as a spiritual philosophy,
            as well as a performance enhancement.




                  I work with any age client and my fees range from $50 to $80

            psychodrama. Since 1980, after relocating from San Francisco, I have
            been affiliated with a few counseling centers serving the LGBT
            community.  I lead ongoing groups for LGBT clients, and have conducted
            many seminars and workshops in national and international conferences,
            especially on experiential and action methods in psychotherapy. I am
            certified in New York State and by the American Society of Group
            Psychotherapy and Psychodrama. I am currently editing a textbook on
            clinical and educational applications of psychodrama and sociometry.

            I serve all populations, that are Normal Neurotics,  regardless of age, sex, sexual preference. While my practice does not emphasize bisexual concerns, I always welcome
            and have particular sensitivity to bisexual issues, along with issues of monogamy, fidelity and
            polyamory.





            I am a founding member of Gestalt Institute of Washington, D.C.
            I have organized numerous workshops in Transpersonal Gestalt & Expressive Arts
            Psychotherapies. I have also organized several workshops with theme: Gay, Straight or Otherwise.

            I am the founder of the Boston Area
            Sexuality and Spirituality Network, a staff writer for Spirituality and
            Sexuality magazine, and author of LIVING WITH VISION: RECLAIMING THE POWER OF
            THE HEART (Knowledge Systems, 1989) and HEALING THE WAR BETWEEN THE GENDERS
            (Forthcoming).  I have led workshops nationally and internationally and
            public speak on a wide variety of subjects including gender and identity,
            gender reconciliation, heart-centered healing and social evolution.





            I have practiced heart-centered, body-centered, psychospiritual therapy for
            nearly two decades in the Boston Area.  I founded the Institute for
            Emotional-Kinesthetic Psychotherapy in 1990.  My interests include trauma
            work, integrating sexuality and spirituality, mentoring the souls journey
            and creating healing community.  I have worked with gay, lesbian, bisexual
            and transgendered people for most all of my years in practice, as well as
            members of various sexual subcultures.





            My Degrees:  I hold a Masters Degree in Organization Development from the
            Sloan School, MIT.  I studied Psychobiology at Yale in the late 70s, prior
            to the availability of body psychotherapy training in any university setting.
             I have been a pioneer in the field of somatic psychology, helping found the
            first state professional association  in Massachusetts in 1989, helping found
            the Somatics Community within the Association for Humanistic Psychology while
            serving on the AHP Board, and through establishing a 3 year apprenticeship
            training program in Emotional-Kinesthetic Psychotherapy (EKP)--the method I
            developed and have practiced since 1985.  My school certified body-centered
            psychotherapists who completed the 1000+ hour program.

            older people, fat people, lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender and intersex
            people, and those living with disabilities.  I work with a wide range of

            practices, those identifying as polyamorous (loving more than one, openly
            & honestly) and those with BDSM/leather affinities.  My sex coaching

            use that capacity to empower your whole life.





            I also offer a variety of speechs and workshops (see website) and am available for guest teaching
            and guest lecturing.  My self-published doctoral dissertation on

            Clinical Social Worker; personal and corporate coach with Arena Group Coaching & Consulting; consultant; producer of the longest-running and largest psychology-in-film series in the
            nation, <a href="http://www.psychologygoestothemovies.org">http://www.psychologygoestothemovies.org</a>, and teacher of film and pop culture theory. Also, disability activist, currently Chair of the City of Cambridge Commission for People with Disabilities.





            As a therapist, I provide individual, couple and family psychotherapy to people of all ages, cultures and nationalities; of all gender and sexual expressions; and to people with disabilities of any kind. My current case load includes Asian, African-American, and West Indian
            clients as well as European and Celtic descendants; and includes bi and gay men, lesbians and bi women, poly individuals and couples, cross-dressers and those in the BDSM D/S scene (see below)
            I work in English. I understand West Indian. My secondary office is fully accessible, but I do not have ASL or TTY.   I will work with any level of trouble of mental illness, including people diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, psychotic illnesses, Aspergers (autism), epilepsy, etc. I also provide consultation of all kinds in psychiatry and therapy issues, second opinions, diagnostic aid, etc.  I work as covering senior clinician for many Cambridge therapists when they are away.
            Some special areas of experience include: ADD & ADHD; Evaluating and supporting people (including children and adolescents) with gender concerns, cross-dressing, and those seeking
            complete gender realignment or correction (I  am an approved provider in this speciality).
            I work with artists, actors, performers, writers, poets, and other creatives. I do pre-marital counseling upon request for couples with differences in race, class or  culture; or for couples in which one partner has a significant disability.





            As a coach, I work with *anyone who has a goal* they are determined
            and committed to achieve. I coach physicians; I coach for ICI, a program for
            women with disabilities seeking employment or career development; I coach
            novelists, screenwriters, contruction workers, nurses, etc.  The Arena
            Method® is used by coaches in my firm and has proven very dynamic -- it
            teaches clients *how to want something* in the way that ensures getting it.
            Fees for coaching are structured differently from most professional
            fees, but are roughly similar to therapy costs overall.  Clients contract
            initially for 90 days, usually including one 30-minute phone meeting per week
            (clients may be in any part of the world) and weekly structured tasks.
            Different service packages provide additional supports according to each
            plan. For the client, coaching requires guts and is a more strenuous course
            than being in therapy; it also works faster to structure current goals.

            **Workshops and lectures I have given include:**

            <ul type="disc">
            <li>**What Therapists Should Know About Working with Bisexual Clients**
            <ul type="circle"><li>How is being bisexual different from being gay or lesbian? What are some specific concerns that bisexuals face? How can a counselor take these issues into account so as to be supportive to their bisexual clients?</li></ul>
            </li>



            <li>**When Someone You Know Is Lesbian, Gay or Bisexual**
            <ul type="circle"><li>It is estimated that one out of every ten people is lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Today more and more gay people are finding it possible to come out to their friends, families and co-workers. Come join an open discussion about perceptions of lesbians, gays and bisexuals in society. We will examine stereotypes, explore homophobia, and talk about what it feels like to be different from others. </li></ul>
            </li>



            <li>**What Psychology Professionals Should Know About Polyamory: The Lifestyles and Mental Health Concerns of Polyamorous Individuals.**
            <ul type="circle">
            <li>Polyamory is a lifestyle in which romantic partners agree that they may each have romantic relationships with other people as well. It is distinguished from infidelity by the presence of honest, supportive communication between partners and lovers about the existence of each of these relationships in their lives. This workshop talks about some of the unique concerns that polyamorous people face, and the ways in which a therapist can be supportive of and helpful to their polyamorous clients.</li></ul>
            </li>



            <li>**Coming Out Issues Workshop**
            <ul type="circle">
            <li>Lesbians, gays and bisexuals are frequently faced with the decision of whether to come out to their friends, families, and co-workers. Coming out can be associated with both benefits and risks. In this workshop, we will talk about how one might make the decision to come out and about ways of coming out to the people in one's life. We will also talk about community resources that can offer support as these choices are made.</li></ul>
            </li>



            <li>**Bi-Gay Dialogue: Are We Family?**
            <ul type="circle">
            <li>There have historically been rifts between the bisexual and gay communities. This workshop will examine the sources of those rifts. We will discuss experiences that these two communities have in common, and what each experiences distinctly. It is hoped that the discussion will foster a sense of support and understanding between the two communities. All are welcome to attend.</li></ul>
            </li>


            <li>**Other workshops / lectures can be custom-created to fit the particular needs of your organization.**</li>
            </ul>



            **Workshop/Lecture Fees:**
            <ul type="disc">(Sliding scale offered for non-profit organizations) I charge $100 per hour of presentation time and $40 per hour of travel time (up to a maximum of 8 hours in a given day), plus travel and lodging expenses as applicable. For instance, a two hour lecture in San Francisco would cost $240: 2 hours of lecture at $100 each, plus a half hour each way from my home in San Mateo county (2x20). A two hour lecture in New York would cost $840 plus travel/lodging expenses: 2 hours of lecture at $100 each, 8 hours of travel time each way (16x40 = $640), plus airfare and overnight lodging accomodations.
            </ul>



            **More about me:**
            <ul type="disc">I am an openly bisexual psychologist, practicing in San Francisco (Noe Valley neighborhood). I have experience working within the Bisexual, Lesbian, Gay, Polyamory, Kink/BDSM, HIV+/POZ, and DD communities.

            I am also a professional drug and alcohol counselor with a speciality with
            bisexual families, gays, and lesbians, and HIV positive individuals.  I
            primarily work with couples. I also organize short term groups. My fee for
            private practice counseling with couples starts with a free consultation, and
            costs $25 to $100 per hour per couple, sliding scale per session.

            IPGs philosophy is rooted in a commitment to serve all people, especially those who are unable to get high quality care from "mainstream" psychology. We were founded with the express purpose of providing therapy to the gay and lesbian population. Many of our staff are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered, and all are gay affirmative. In the last few years we have expanded to include services for bisexuals, transgendered people, and those involved in the BDSM community. We are internationally recognized for our expertise in this area. All clients are seen in our private offices, where strict confidentiality is maintained. The majority of our
            referrals are word of mouth, but our clients may be referred by their insurance companies, or by other professionals. We are convenient to most of south/central and northern Jersey and lower Manhattan, are on most managed care panels, and accept most insurance plans.

            I am a bi-friendly lesbian therapist who believes societal oppression
            affects mental health. I have been counseling people since 1979, using empathy, humor and intuition to assist in the healing process.  My style is supportive and interactive.  I focus on
            solving present-day problems, bringing in your past history as needed to shed light on patterns
            that no longer work for you.  I see therapy as a mutual partnership, with you as the expert on
            your own life.




            My specialties include:  abuse survivors, sexual concerns, recovery from
            addictions, relationship problems, disability/chronic illness, and sexual minorities (bisexual,
            lesbian, transgender, gay, polyamory, BDSM).  I see individuals who are at least 15 years old, and couples/families/polygroups.  I also offer EMDR, a very effective trauma
            reduction technique.




            Phone sessions are possible for the homebound, or residents of California
            outside the San Francisco Bay Area.  My office is in a tranquil garden setting on the ground
            floor, and is scent- free.  I am a member and former Board President of Gaylesta, the Gay,
            Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Psychotherapist Association of the Bay Area.

            I am San Francisco based psychotherapist, educator, researcher, and
            author. I have been in private practice for 17 years working with a wide
            range of people and issues. I am experienced in working individuals,
            couples, groups, and families with issues involved in traditional,
            alternative, bi, and poly lifestyles and relationships. I am openly
            bisexual and known in the community for my work with bisexual, gay,
            lesbian, queer, and questioning people.




            My particular interests as a therapist include helping with: overcoming
            depression and anxiety; enhancing self-expression and creativity; using
            self-reflection and meditation for personal growth and self-discovery;
            acknowledging and maintaining a self-affirming bisexual, gay, or lesbian
            identity; understanding and healing from childhood physical, sexual and
            emotional abuse; facing and working with ACA/ co-dependency/substance and
            other recovery and family of origin related issues; understanding
            sexuality and intimacy in relationships; working with issues of monogamy,
            non-monogamy, and polyamory in relationships; and enhancing communication
            skills for everyday situations and for negotiating the structure and
            details of consensual adult relationships.




            I conducted the first large-scale study on bisexual identity and have
            contributed several chapters on bisexuality to LGBT psychology books. I
            have presented workshops on sexual diversity & bisexual issues at
            professional conferences, graduate schools, and community agencies, as
            well as at U.S. and international conferences on bisexuality. I am a
            member of the editorial board of the Journal of Bisexuality and the guest
            editor of special issues of the Journal on current research on
            bisexuality and on affirmative psychotherapy with bisexual women and
            bisexual men. I was a member of the Task Force that wrote the recently
            adopted American Psychological Associations Guidelines for Psychotherapy
            with LGB Clients. I am Co-Chair of the Committee on Bisexual Issues in
            Psychology of the APAs Division 44 (Society for the Psychological Study
            of LGB Issues).

            I am a bisexual psychologist and energy/journeywork practitioner.  I have 26 years of experience doing psychotherapy with English-speaking clients of all sexual and gender orientations in the Boston Area. I work with individuals, families and both monogamous and polyamorous relationships. In terms of age, I see folks in their teens all the way through some courageous women and men in their elder years.




            My training includes expressive and creative versions of psychotherapy as well as traditional "talk therapy" and I enjoy doing both. In fact, I just enjoy and am grateful each client I see. After 26 years, I am still awed by my clients' wisdom, courage, and resiliency and honored to help with healing or personal growth. I have particular interest in LGBT issues, recovery from addictions, including co-dependency and eating disorders, and trauma. I also assist clients with depression, anxiety, grieving, life transitions, and career issues. I also work with those who want to include their religious or spiritual perspective in their psychotherapy.




            I did the first research on bisexual women's and men's experiences of mental health services and do presentations on this and other topics having to do with "bi" issues in the Boston Area and at National and International Conferences on Bisexuality.  An article presenting my research will be in the upcoming Journal of Bisexuality to be published early in 2004. I am Co-Chair of the Committee on Bisexual Issues in Psychology of the American Psychological Association's Division 44 (Society for the Psychological Study of LGB Issues).




            My fee: $100. I can slide lower in some cases of need. I am not currently on insurance panels, but that should change during 2004. Some insurance plans will partially reimburse members for sessions with non-network providers and I am happy to work with clients to facilitate insurer co-payments when that is the case.

            I assist those entering a transition in their lives struggling with
            Relationship Issues, Additions, Value changes, Exploration of Gender and
            Sexual Orientation and its influence upon ones choices, and the pain,
            confusion and excitement of personal growth. I use a Task Centered
            Approach to treatment and begin by listening carefully and setting goals
            for each client and our work together.




            In my view, the concerns people bring to therapy are often not a matter
            of illness, but part of a clients quest for greater wholeness and
            gratification in life. I believe that the human psyche has the ability to
            heal itself and that I can help individuals facilitate the healing
            process. I further believe that therapy needs to be a good fit between
            therapist and client. I offer a comfortable, safe and confidential
            environment where clients can better cope with their personal issues,
            become more self aware and gain a better understanding of their
            interactions with the people in their past, present and future. For those

            Typically this type of therapy will benefit individuals and couples seeking

            empathic and supportive yet provocatively challenging. They are known for
            helping move people beyond their comfort zones, look at their lives in
            different contexts, and transition through challenges into awareness,
            change, and growth. They are passionate advocates of helping people discover
            and give life to their unique and personal voices. Through collaborative
            therapy they help people in the following areas:

            *       Understand the challenges and strengths of sexual awareness


            *       Learn to embrace and celebrate sex and sexuality

            Relationships


            *       Work through life transitions (marriage, midlife, divorce, custody, remarriage, lifestyle changes)

            *       Managing feelings of anger, fear, shock, despair, and devastation

            *       Difficulty accepting your spouse or partners sexuality


            *       Fears of having been exposed to sexually transmitted diseases or AIDS





            Bisexuality


            *       Discover bisexuality as a powerful metaphor for the spiritual self and can bring awareness to other areas of duality in your life


            *       Explore bisexuality or being bi-curious. Am I on a journey from bi-curious to bisexual? Am I on a journey of exploring bisexuality and then accepting or rejecting it?


            *       Explore the differences of being ashamed of being bisexual versus the shame our present society places on those   living a bisexual lifestyle

            I am a licensed psychologist in private practice in Harvard Square in
            Cambridge, MA.  I completed my pre-doctoral internship and post-doctoral
            training at Massachusetts General Hospital and Fenway Community Health, a
            health center that serves primarily the BGLT community, and I remain
            affiliated with both.  I offer individual psychotherapy to adults of all
            ages, and my specialty area is with Bisexual individuals, Transgender and
            Gender Variant individuals, and Gay and Lesbian individuals.  Other
            specialties include anxiety, depression, relationship difficulties,
            mindfulness-based therapies, and trauma.  My past research has addressed
            anti-BGL hate-crime victimization, and I have taught and made
            professional presentations concerning that topic, as well as the
            commonalities between the Bisexual and Transgender movements.  My
            standard fee is $125 per session.  I am a pending provider for BC/BS and
            other private insurance companies, and may be able to offer a sliding
            scale depending on availability.  My private practice is located in
            Harvard Square, quite accessible by subway and bus.  Currently my hours
            are Thursday afternoons only.

            My goal is to help each client cope with his or her unique life
            challenges, and to thrive beyond any perceived limitations. My mindset is
            compassionate and avoids pathologizing. Instead I focus on feelings,
            options, honest reflection, perspectives, choices, and skill building.
            I work from a multicultural perspective, and try to help clients
            shed any social prejudices that may have become part of a negative
            self-image.





            I have worked with couples, families, and individual adults,
            from children through adults, of many different races, ethnicities, and
            orientations. Within the adult bisexual community I have worked with
            both couples and individuals to address issues including intimacy
            (physical, emotional, sexual), sexuality & sexual identity,
            communication, and conflict.   I have also worked with clients
            on parenting, cross-cultural concerns, gender, MTF & FTM transitions,
            leather, mid-life, body image, considering parenting,
            spirituality, HIV/AIDS, care-giving, and grief & loss.





            My office is in San Francisco on 24th St, convenient to the Castro, Noe
            Valley, Glen Park, and Outer Mission; it is near several bus lines (48,
            24, J, & 35) and a 10-minute walk from the 24th St. BART station.  I
            provide services in English and French, and speak rudimentary Spanish.  I
            have applied to various insurance panels,  so please call to check if
            that is a consideration.





            I have worked at UCSF/AIDS Health Project and SF/CMHS Center for Special
            Problems; currently I am on the teaching faculty at the California
            Pacific Medical Center. I have over 15 years experience working with
            individuals and couples, in various capacities. If you would like more
            information, or to get a clearer sense of who I am and how I work, please
            call for a free telephone interview.

            for 30 pounds and will last 45 minutes. (If you are unsure on whether
            therapy is for you or would like to ask some questions/meet me prior to the
            first session, a shorter, initial consultation of 20 minutes is offered for
            free, usually on the telephone or online, but face-to-face is also available
            if preferred). Discounts are available when paying for a block of sessions
            in advance. Please enquire during the first meeting. If the session is to

            I am a California  licensed marriage and relationship therapist, a Board
            certified sexologist, and  a syndicated sex and relationship columnist. My
            Ask Isadora column has been  running in alternative weekly papers worldwide
            for  25+ years. Web surfers can find my  columns on my online free
            interactive Sexuality Forum at www.askisadora.com. I am the author of two  collections
            of Q & As from my columns: Lets Talk Sex, and Ask  Isadora as well as Sex
            Information, May I Help You?, a peek behind  the scenes of a sex help phone
            line which still flourishes in San Francisco  today. My last book Doing It:
            Real People Having Really Good Sex is a  collection of helpful hints and
            titillating tidbits from column readers and  Forum web site users. I have also
            contributed chapters to several books  including Herotica (Down There
            Press), Dick For A Day (Villard  NY), The Moment Of Truth (Seal Press) and Single
            Woman Of A Certain  Age (Inner Ocean Publishing, Inc.) I have been a radio
            talk show host,  frequent and popular TV and radio talk show guest, and a
            lecturer and workshop  leader on a variety of communications topics. I conduct
            my private psychotherapy  practice in the San Francisco Bay Area
            specializing in establishing and  improving relationships (traditional and non),
            communication skills, and  sexuality.

            I work with individuals, partners, couples, families and groups. We explore the spoken and unspoken dynamics of intimacy and boundaries with self and others, of parent-child bonding, and of navigating conflicts, wounding, and trauma past or present. I also work with addictions. My approach is holistic, body-oriented, offers use of expressive arts, and celebrates diversity, particularly of sexual orientation and partnering styles, gender, and spirituality.





            I consider therapy a collaborative process, so I work best with clients who have a sense of what troubles them and at least a vague vision for the differences they want. That is where I come in.





            I will use my skills to help you identify what specifically is not working for you in your life, develop a vision for the way you wish things were instead, and then narrow that gap. I will follow your lead in setting goals together for the therapy while also utilizing my professional perspectives and experience. My intention is to support an integrated dynamic within your body, mind, emotions, spirit, relationships with others, and with your unique conception of the world in which you live.





            While we will probably explore your past experiences, our focus will be on your present experiences and your hopes and desires for your future.





            I have offered professional trainings on Poly Parenting Issues, Self-Care, and Expressive Arts Therapy Techniques, and am in progress on a Poly-Aware Professionals Clinical Handboook.

            I offer post-structural, feminist therapy that is
            affirmative of each persons individual orientation, however they choose to
            self-identify for themselves or as part of a larger community.  I have
            extensive experience in increasing peoples ability to regulate moods and
            emotions; decrease co-dependent behaviors with family of origin or romantic
            partners; and increase self-efficacy.  I have a long history of working with
            lesbian, bisexual and questioning women, and expertise in helping clients
            come out or deal with the oppression that can occur when interfacing with a
            heterocentric/sexist society.   While not every client will have a need to
            discuss their orientation, every client deserves a therapist who is
            completely accepting and affirmative of their orientation.

            Reed Lindberg, M.A., L.P.C., is the Managing Director of the Boulder
            Psychotherapy Institute. He is a therapist with 20 years experience.
            He refers to his work as Relationship, Sex and Romance Counseling.





            Reed works with people of all sexual orientations, and feels
            privileged to share in the inner and interpersonal worlds of his
            clients and to work with them on their personal and relationship
            issues. He works to restore playfulness and trust to a relationship
            that may have grown mired in everyday life. His therapy is a mutual
            exploration of a couples issues and strengths. He does work with both
            individuals and couples.





            Reed uses an existential perspective supplemented by Gestalt therapy
            and other approaches. Existential therapy starts from the assumption
            that we do not have a static self and are free to make significant
            changes in our lives and in the ways that we relate to each other. It
            encourages each persons freedom while building relationship. It works
            with authenticity. Neither freedom nor connectedness are ignored.





            A therapist must be willing to go there with clients if he is to
            help them extricate themselves from the impact of the past. But he
            believes that it is the release of creativity and authentic
            relatedness in the present that is the aim of psychotherapy. Reed
            offers a free initial meeting to help see if we will work well together.





            Reed also works with language and communication to help change the
            style of a couples dynamics. Resentments and even anger may tinge a
            couples interactions - a trusted third party, through observation and
            coaching, can help modify the words and attitudes that bring
            frustration to a relationship.





            To understand, respect, and be present to the lived reality of others
            is one of the great privileges of living in relationship and of being
            a psychotherapist.

            Often times, how we feel about ourselves, others, and situations has a lot to do with the stories of our lives and problems that are manufactured in social, cultural and political contexts. I collaborate with clients to create alternate stories that creatively solve their problems and increase their fulfillment in life. As a result, I am very committed to understanding and incorporating cultural aspects of the clients life into treatment. I view therapy as a collaborative experience where we select goals/objectives that will help you become the person you want or experience the relief you seek.






            One important mission for me is to provide lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer communities an affirming therapeutic environment where ones sexual orientation and gender identity are understood and supported, free from the judgment that homosexual, bisexual or transgender experiences are pathological. I honor the range of diversity within all of us.






            I provide psychological assessment and psychotherapy for individuals experiencing anxiety and mood disorders, persons grappling with gender and/or sexual identity issues, or those adjusting to the many ways of being masculine. I also provide therapy for persons seeking help related to the lived-experience of AIDS/HIV, sexual abuse and PTSD.

            I'm a psychologist and psychodynamic psychotherapist who works with individuals and relationships. I specialise in GSRD (Gender, Sex and Relationship Diversities: LGBTQ+, non-monogamies, kink, sex work) and race, culture neurodiversity and disability. I have specialist training in trauma, PTSD and CPTSD (complex PTSD) and dissociation. I have extensive experience of working with adult survivors of childhood trauma. I speak English, Hebrew and Dutch.





            I work with compassion, respect and acceptance. I don't judge. Therapy is a collaborative process where I am your expert guide. It's important to me that you maintain control at all times and feel safe. I do my best to hear you. There is nothing we can't talk about. That includes how we -- therapist and client -- relate to each other. We can discuss anything while ensuring that clear boundaries and mutual consent are respected.

            My approach to treatment is informed by multicultural counseling principles and by existential/humanistic philosophy, which suggests that all people are searching for meaning in their lives and aspire to feel connected to others, while struggling with feeling alone in the world. Feeling isolated can be particularly poignant for bisexual people. I have worked with clients from diverse racial and ethnic groups, from various socioeconomic circumstances, of different ages and sexual and gender identities. I provide affirming support while challenging clients to identify obstacles to the realization of their potential. My office is conveniently located in Union Square; I offer affordable fees and a sliding scale application for clients in need.





            I specialize in working with clients who identify as transgender, HIV+ or bisexual, those involved in BDSM, kinky, or polyamorous relationships, and any clients struggling with depression, anxiety, or life adjustments (aging, career change, bereavement). I have experience working with same sex and serodiscordant couples. I appreciate working with clients who have a desire to achieve or maintain recovery from addiction to substances, sex, pornography, or codependent relationships, as I have personal experience with recovery. I believe that each of us has the capacity to change and that altering patterns of self-destructive behavior enables us to create lives that are more free and fulfilling.





            As a researcher, I have given presentations and workshops at the New York Mental Health Counselors Association, American Psychological Association, Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, Philadelphia Trans Health Conference, Southeastern Regional Counseling Psychology conference, the Institute for Human Identity, and the State Society on Aging of New York. I am a hotline volunteer for the New York Anti-Violence Project, a former peer counselor for Identity House, and a former counseling intern at Iris House, a community center seving people living with HIV/AIDS.

            Folks who identify as bisexual or bi-curious have distinctive concerns.  While not every client will have a need to discuss their orientation, every client deserves a therapist who is completely accepting and affirmative of their orientation and gender expresssion.





            I have facilitated adult bisexual and bi-curious mens groups at Fenway Community Health in Boston for the last 7 years.  Groups have included college students to older folks and have addressed a broad range of subjects, including <u>Getting Past Stereotypes</u>, <u>Monogamy and Polyamory</u>, <u>Bisexuality and Desire</u> <u>Coming Out</u>, <u>Safer Sex</u>, <u>Queer Sexuality</u>, and <u>Bisexuality in the Workplace</u>.  Check out the groups website at the <a href="http://www.fenwayhealth.org/site/PageServer?pagename=FCHC_srv_services_bi"><u>Fenway Community Health - Bisexual Health page</u></a>





            I have presented educational workshops on bisexuality for therapists through the National Association of Social Workers.  As a previous member of the Massachusetts statewide LGBT Liaison Committee to the Department of Children and Families, I continually advocated for the inclusion of bisexual families' concerns.  Through my initiative, the agency began marching in the Boston Youth Pride parade each May, visibly demonstrating support for the spectrum of LGBT youth.

            In addition to my work with adults, I work with kids, teens, and young adults, including gender-variant and trans youth.  I have worked with youth with mental health concerns for over ten years, both 1-on-1 and with family members in the room.  Areas of experience include a broad range of mental health, social, educational, and familial stresses, as well as parent consultation.  I have supported numerous families seeking special education supports both within and beyond their public school district.

            I am a queer therapist whose clients include individuals and couples from the GLBTQ, kink, and BDSM communities.





            Although often difficult periods of change can give us opportunities to bring our lives more in alignment with what has true value and meaning for ourselves. I work with people during important transitions in their lives, for instance either starting or leaving a significant job or relationship.





            Communication, trust, intimacy and/ or sexual issues with your partner? I am very comfortable working with traditional, alternative and queer couples. I assist you and your partner to develop better communication and understanding around sensitive topics such as betrayal, intimacy and trust.





            As former Director of the Eating Disorders program at Community Institute of San Rafael, Marin, I work with people who obsess that if they only had the perfect weight their lives would work out. So many of us through overdieting and body hatred have lost our connection to ourselves. The body instead of being home for our psyche/ spirit becomes the battleground. I work with clients to get off the fasting/ feasting cycle and reclaim their appetite for life. I also lead support/ psycho-educational groups for women with food/ weight and body image struggles.





            Do you feel emotionally stuck in the past? You might be suffering from trauma. I help my clients move through past traumatic experiences using EMDR (eye movement desensitization reprocessing) This well researched method has fast and effective results in working with people suffering from trauma. I also help my clients release the cellular and muscular memory of the trauma (which is where trauma is often stored) using somatic psychotherapy. This is an approach that taps into body awareness and mindfulness, which does not involve touch.





            Please check my website (above) for more information and articles written.

I also treat sexual problems and concerns and have training in sex therapy. I work with clients ages 12 and up, and treat couples and families as well as individuals. I offer therapy groups for adolescents and young adults including LGBTQ-spectrum groups. I am sex-positive and queer-affirmative. I understand that while identity issues may be a focus of therapy, in other cases, a client may simply seek a therapist who understands their identity so that they can safety and comfortably talk about whatever else may be of concern.

            I offer individual and couples psychotherapy and sex therapy. I specialize in helping clients initiate and navigate major transitions in their relationships, careers, and academic pursuits. I especially welcome folks who identify as LGBTQ+, transgender/non-binary, kinky, polyamorous/non-monogamous.

            My approach to therapy is warm and collaborative, and I like to balance practical problem-solving with deeper emotional processing. Let’s work together to come up with creative solutions that fit your unique life! We'll get you unstuck and back on a path toward your goals.

            All therapy services are virtual at this time. I offer a FREE 15-min video consultation, so email me to set up a call and see if I’m the right therapist for you!

        description: As a psychotherapist who has a background in social justice, mental health, substance use, trauma, and harm reduction, I bring a unique perspective to the therapy room. For some, it is refreshing and welcoming and facilitates exploration of the self. For others, this approach is unfamiliar and perhaps even distinctly different from past therapeutic relationships. I work with a variety of adults ranging in age, gender, experience, race, sexuality, spiritual path, relationship structure, and family dynamics.

            I am a queer-identified licensed clinical psychologist with a private practice. I also supervise trainees at Queer LifeSpace, a nonprofit providing low-fee mental health and substance abuse services to the LGBTQQI communities. My office is centrally located in the Mission District of San Francisco, where I offer individual psychotherapy for adults.





            My specific areas of interest and expertise are:





            Alcohol and Substance Use Concerns


            Harm Reduction and Motivational Interviewing Techniques


            Depression, Anxiety, and Mood Disorders


            Recovery from Trauma and Loss


            Social Justice Conversations


            Habit Change and Goal-Setting


            Employment and Career Consultation


            Exploring Identity


            Anger Management and Conflict Resolution





            I welcome all to my practice, and am particularly interested in inviting those who may not feel as comfortable in all treatment spaces: members of the LGBTQQIAAP communities, gender-creative folks, people wanting to talk about size acceptance, people of color and members of marginalized groups, those in non-traditional relationships (polyamory, kink/BDSM), iconoclastic artists and activists, Burners and nerds, and everyone else who struggles with how to succeed on this planet without forcing themselves to fit in.





            My rate is $150. I am currently an in-network provider for Cigna Behavioral Health, and am in process with other insurance plans. If I am not on your plan, I can provide invoices you may submit for reimbursement. Free initial telephone consultation.

        description: At my practice Divergent Worlds I provide psychotherapy for adults, young adults, and relationships; supervision for associates; and clinical consultations. I approach this work with a collaborative style, supporting people as they engage in their therapy experience. I provide non-judgmental supportive therapy for people with a range of sexual, relationship, and gender identities and experiences, including LGBTQIQA2S, BDSM, sexual variations, furries, non-monogamy, non binary gender and gender fluidity, and sex workers. I specialize in working through sexuality/gender/relationship related concerns, and supporting these folks with the other aspects of their inner and outer worlds. In my practice and in my world, I acknowledge and work to address systematic and environmental barriers and oppression, and I strive to build a practice and a therapeutic space that includes all aspects of your world. I focus on trauma recovery, body image, disability, impulse control, depression, anxiety, creating boundaries, self esteem, empowerment, substance abuse, adaptive coping skills, and relationships.  I believe that therapy should be accessible for everybody who wants it. As part of my efforts to increase access to supportive services, I use a sliding scale and accept Medi-Cal. Please feel free to contact me for more information or to schedule an appointment.

            I work with individuals 18 years and older, couples, and other family constellations including polyamorous families. I particularly enjoy working with women, LGBQ folks, and young adults.






            Common issues people bring include child abuse, post-traumatic stress, relationships (including open, polyamorous and kinky relationships), depression, anxiety, LGBQ , mid-life, work, and alcohol and other drugs. I also am interested in working with children/ grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, introverts, first responders, rural residents, military brats, academics, highly intelligent people, classical musicians, human service managers, and social justice advocates.






            I use a combination of techniques that best meet your needs, including psychodynamic, cognitive behavioral, family systems, and solution-focused approaches.






            My underlying orientation is looking at the person(s) in environment, which includes a strong social justice commitment. It is important to understand how issues such as lack of access to housing, a poor economy, homophobia, sexism, and racism impact upon what we perceive as our individual or family problems.






            I can do therapy over the Internet if you are in California or Florida.  If you are on PHP/Beacon Medi-Cal in Sonoma, Marin and some other northern California counties I can now do online therapy.

            Welcoming clients to my busy UK Midlands-based private practice for weekly or fortnightly appointments, in person locally or nationally/internationally via Skype.





            Personal therapy provided focuses on exploring and effecting change on past patterns, facilitating personal growth, self-development and self-actualisation. Specialisations; sexuality, gender, abuse, trauma, depression, anxiety and relationship issues. Taking you from who and where you are now to who and where you want to be, using your own mind, body and spirit.





            Familiar and experienced with alternative lifestyle choices and identities, therefore particularly but not exclusively working with adult and young adult clients from within LGBTQ, polyamory, tantra, spirituality and kink communities. Knowing that this is an aspect of your life that I will not automatically pathologise often provides a strong and creative start to working together.





            Additional experience that informs my practice includes life coaching, mentoring, cognitive behavioural hypnotherapy and N.L.P. Rich background of Consulting, Presenting and Facilitating extensive classes, workshops, groups and talks e.g. at five UK Universities and for national events/organisations such as (keynote speaker at) the Pink Therapy Conference, SMPride, Kinkfest 2004 (Organising Director), Polyday, Tantra4GayMen, Unitarian Youth Workers Training Conference. KAP listed (NCSF Kink Aware Professionals).





            I have a reputation for healing the healers and holding those who hold. Is it time you put on your own oxygen mask first?

            I am a bisexuality aware professional that works on the San Francisco Bay Area Peninsula. As the voted San Francisco Bay Area American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors & Therapists (AASECT) leader, I am extremely active in promoting positive sexual health in various Bay Area communities. Within these communities there are members that identify as bisexual, gay, lesbian, transgendered, kink & BDSM friendly, swingers, cisgendered and polyamorous.





            In my work, I constantly strive to grow and learn as a therapist in order to provide the best opportunities to my clients and the communities in which I serve. These include reading various articles in the field of sexual health and bisexuality, attending on-going trainings and workshops held by SSTAR, AASECT, Good Vibrations and other well-known sexual health organizations, and working with clients that identify as bisexual. Some of my areas of focus include kink, BDSM, polyamory, high-low desire, pornography, grief & loss, infidelity, self-esteem, career counseling, and overall relationship counseling.
            Additionally, I have a podcast called Lets Do It With Melissa Risso which focuses on promoting healthy conversations around both mental and sexual health.





            With patience and persistence, my clients cultivate greater confidence and self-esteem, richer relationships, and more emotional balance and health. I believe that we all need someone to talk with who will listen and accept us as we are, without judgment. Because of this, I provide my clients with a warm, nonjudgmental environment- a safe place to explore the issues that may be preventing people from living the life they want.

            I have been working in behavioral health field since 1994, been in private practice since 2004 and a sex positive sex therapist since 2008.





            Although I have experience in working with a wide range of sexual dysfunctions, I have an expert focus is in atypical sexual expressions and emerging definitions of healthy sexuality.  My professional and personal coaching services are unique and different than most practicing professionals in that it incorporates various mainstream clinical best practices like Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, with depth psychological approaches to understanding conscious and unconscious forces contributing to long held and frustrating patterns.  At its detriment, modern training and practice of counseling and therapy primarily focus on behavioral changes, which are minimally impactful and do not address long term, unresolved core psychological issues.  These unresolved issues present themselves as sexual dysfunctions, psychiatric illness, maladaptive behaviors or substance abuse/dependence which impede or block healthy professional and personal growth and development.  Core psychological issues involve, in part, male and feminine energy; sexual and non-sexual power dynamics; as well as the "shadow" aspect of the unconscious self, which drives uncontrollable (conscious & unconscious) desires and ineffective redundant behaviors.  It is because of this and other limitations; traditional counseling and therapy results in short lived success, increased frustration and the eroding of hope each time the individual or couple returns for additional treatment.  Like professional consultations, educational seminars and trainings, psychotherapy and sex therapy sessions are dynamic and tailored to the clients specific needs and goals.





            Personally, I identify, in part, as bisexual/Queer man.

            I am the Founder and President of Affirming Therapy Center, a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, as well as an AASECT Certified Sex Therapist. My clinical caseload is currently full and I am not currently accepting new clients. I now focus my efforts on training and mentoring my team of Sex-Positive therapists, and I provide supervision and case consultation to all ATC clinicians.

            My work has taken me to human sexuality seminars, psychotherapy conferences, events, and cultures around the world. These travels have given me a rich appreciation of the incredible diversity found in this wonderful mosaic we call “people”. Through these adventures, I continuously expand my awareness and learnings of how I can best honor and support the many expressions and embodiments of Gender, Sexual, and Relationship Diversity (GSRD).

            I am most passionate about normalizing sexual behaviors, fostering an understanding that different is not necessarily wrong, and giving people permission to pursue and explore their own desires, aspirations, dreams, and ultimately, themselves.

            I believe in the importance of creating a space where people feel open to and supported in their process of growth. My practice, Affirming Therapy Center, is such a space. We are here to help you in your unique journey -- to explore and process through your events, thoughts, feelings, emotions, and patterns. My vision is for you to live your best life!

            Focus: Adult Individuals, Couples/Relationships, Sex Therapy

            Specializations:
            - BDSM, Fetish Exploration, and Kink Therapist
            - LGBTQ-Friendly Therapy
            - Non-Monogamy
            - Relationship Therapy

            *Please note: I am active in the local community and occasionally attend local social events. So if you also attend local community events, we may know many of the same people. If this is an issue, please let me know upfront and I will do my best to provide with a more appropriate referral for you.

            Philosophy and Approach: I believe that each person deserves to thrive and create the best life possible for them. I utilize a multifaceted approach that is tailored to the client depending on their presenting concerns, goals, needs, and strengths. Sessions are person centered and address treatment goals by applying Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Positive Psychology, Motivational Interviewing, and Mindfulness techniques.





            I specialize in gender and sexual minority support. I have experience with youth and adults in the LGBTQIAQ and Poly-Alt-Kink communities. I believe that individuals have the right to get support from someone that is familiar with the unique considerations of these communities. I also understand how membership in these communities is not one's entire identity. As individuals all people face a complex range of ups and downs in life which may or may not be impacted by intersectional identities.





            Fees: Group facilitation, individual counseling and partners counseling services are all offered at a standard rate of $40 per 50 minute session after an initial $75 fee for a 90 min intake session. I offer a sliding scale in situations of significant financial hardship so that finances are not a barrier to receiving support. I provide a quarterly support group for current clients at no fee.

            I work from a collaborative, authentic approach in Downtown Los Angeles. I am an LGBTQ+ affirmative therapist, have a background in multicultural counseling, and have experience in working with clients as they navigate emotional, behavioral, and social issues.





            I believe that therapy is a space where you can share your experience while being heard and appreciated as you are; together we will reflect on your unique strengths, identities, and obstacles to create steps towards change or growth that feel not only tolerable, but also possible.

I am also trained in Applied Existential Psychotherapy which centers on Gestalt work and choice as a vital part of personal work and psychotherapy. I write a blog which I publish on my website that is a good sampling of my work and orientation. I am also queer and genderqueer which is one of the populations I work with. I have bisexual clients and see them needing more resources to embody their sexual identity and enjoy being that for them.

            Embracing Pleasure is heart-centered, trauma-informed coaching, bodywork, and education for adults of all genders, sizes, relationship statuses, and sexualities who are struggling with identity, sexuality, intimacy, or trauma and who long to be seen. I find my clients come to me because something has changed in the way they are relating to themselves, their lover(s), and/or the world. Something feels off, and my clients are looking for support and guidance to a greater depth of experience and a more whole version of themselves and their sex/life!





            My approach is based on my Master's degree in Sacred Erotic Psychology, certifications in Sexological Bodywork, Clinical Trauma Professional, and Transpersonal Hypnotherapy, as well as numerous hours of work with clients and with myself. I have extensive knowledge of and personal experience with truma, kink/bdsm, polyamory/non-monogamy, queer/lgbp+ and trans/non-binary experiences, and more.





            Sessions are a blend of therapeutic talking/mind-based interaction, body-based/embodiment exercises, and/or educational-therapeutic touch. The session experience is completely dependent upon your goals, and focused on increasing your experience of embodiment and intimacy with yourself, others, and the world.

            I am a body-centered psychotherapist specializing in Grief & Loss, Life Transitions, Bisexuality & Fluidity, LGBTQ issues, Self-esteem, Social Anxiety, Trauma, Shame & Resiliency, Identity & Empowerment.





            My greatest passion as a therapist is helping people feel more alive and empowered with who they uniquely are. I believe the more intimately connected we are to our own feelings, needs, desires and strengths; the better able we are to experience this in all areas of life.





            No matter how we may "label" ourselves sexually, ethnically, by gender, age, or current life challenges, we all basically desire a life filled with love, purpose, meaning and increased connection with others.  I am dedicated in helping you gain this for yourself.

            As a therapist, I am passionate about supporting people on their journeys to discovering their true selves, and helping them to build greater resources for meeting all of lifes challenges.





            Identifying as bisexual, queer, or in other non-normative ways that seem to defy labeling, have their unique challenges. You may feel rejected or misunderstood by many different groups, or you may have been the subject of stereotypes and judgments about your sexuality. Like any other form of discrimination, these experiences can lead to feelings of alienation, invisibility, and lowered self-worth, which have a particularly negative impact on mental health.





            My approach is to hold a safe space for you to be seen and heard. Together, our work may include increasing self-esteem and self-empowerment, dialoguing with the inner critic, who may be holding negative self-beliefs, and coping with the outer critics - the people around you who do not seem to understand.





            I specialize in somatic psychotherapy, which is an effective approach to working with depression, anxiety, trauma and PTSD. I also have experience working with intimate relationships, communication problems, life transitions, adjusting to change, and finding life meaning and purpose.

            Hello there! I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Associate working with individuals, relationships/couples, and families. As a systemically trained therapist, I take a holistic approach when working with my clients. I work with adolescents and adults, and I specifically focus on addressing concerns of individuals in the LGBTQIA+ community, as well as those in the kink/BDSM community and consensual non-monogamy.





            I am trained in addressing individual and relational concerns including (but not limited to) areas of substance abuse, body image and eating disorders, technology use/concerns, trauma, sexual and/or gender identity, diversity/minority issues, acculturation/assimilation concerns, depression/anxiety, stress, relationship concerns and pre-marital counseling, infidelity, grief & loss, and family communication/conflict.





            I am currently finishing my doctorate degree in Couples, Marriage, and Family Therapy at Texas Tech University, and I have published several articles and presented workshops around issues of disordered eating, substance abuse, technology use, and bisexuality/sexual identity.





            I am fluent in English and Russian.






            I also provide online/teletherapy to clients residing anywhere in Texas.

            I work with adolescents (aged 12 and above), adults, families, couples, and other relationship constellations to improve relationships and facilitate personal growth. I have experience working with gender, sexual, and relational diversity and am open-minded and non-judgmental. As your therapist, I will strive to create a warm, collaborative relationship with you. My goal is to create a meaningful therapeutic context in which each client feels safe, seen, and heard. Whether your concerns relate to life transitions, depression, anxiety, relationships, external stressors, or personal growth, our work will be in a caring environment. My therapeutic approach is grounded in the most current, culturally-aware, trauma-informed, and evidence-based practices, including Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), Mindfulness, Narrative Therapy, and Motivational Interviewing.

            My own experiences of personal transition have shown me that life affords us many opportunities for growth and change - as individuals, and in our relationships with family members, partners, and friends. In my practice I focus on thinking and attachment patterns, and on the many personal, social, and cultural factors that contribute to resilience. Whatever your goals for therapy, I’m here to help.

            Please note: Since I’m active in the local community and attend local events, it’s possible that we may know some of the same people, and this is something we should discuss at the outset. If it’s a concern, I’ll provide you with appropriate referrals.

            The unique thing I offer is a deep understanding of what it's like to live "in between". To live in the middle space of the sexuality spectrum. Whether you identify as bisexual, pansexual, queer, or fluid; I'm here for you. Living in that middle place is something I have specialized training and experience working with. I am passionate about supporting the bi+ community and helping the invisible become visible. One of my favorite things I have done in my career is run bi+ support groups.





            We will work together to help you feel more at ease, empowered, and maybe even allow yourself to be imperfect once in a while. When you begin to accept all the parts of yourself with compassion, things begin to change. You find your voice. I look forward to discovering your voice together.





            If you are seeking a therapist who is: social justice minded, an anti-racist ally, sex positive, feminist, and bisexual+ affirming, let's talk. Schedule a FREE 20 minute phone consultation with me on my website: www.drlindseytherapy.com

            I am an openly bi/queer-identified psychotherapist with a private practice in downtown Seattle. I work with people who experience themselves as outsiders to the dominant culture: creative artists, performers, activists, LGBTQ, and gender-nonconforming folks, and anyone else who feels "other" due to cultural or family bias. My approach is trauma-informed, anti-oppression-focused, social-justice oriented and politicized. I have provided trainings on affirmative care for LGBTQ children and youth for Cascadia Training, The Saying it Out Loud Conference and Gender Odyssey, and I served on the Advisory Board on the Children's Hospital Gender Clinic from 2016 -2018. Most recently I have decided to devote more time to supporting fellow bisexuals with their mental health and have started training other clinicians on best practices for working with bisexual clients (for more information on my trainings, go to: http://www.christinamalecka.com/workshops/2019/1/27/so-youre-straight-now-clinical-considerations-for-working-with-bipansexual-clients).





            I am trained extensively in LGBTQ health issues, intimate partner violence, adoption and trauma, and practice EMDR and Attachment-Focused EMDR.  I work with individual clients age 13 and up and I am available for consultation with other therapists. For more about my work, go to my website at christina@christinamalecka.com.

            I am a bisexual-, pansexual-, poly- and open relationship-affirming therapist. I provide therapy to teens, adults, and couples who want to connect with their personal values, live more authentically, and find deeper connection in relationships. I understand the unique cultural challenges of being bisexual, without making assumptions about your personal experience. My style of therapy is genuine, energetic, down-to-earth, skill-based, and filled with humor. Therapy is a transformational experience that can help move you from feeling stuck and hopeless to realizing (or remembering!) what your strengths are and using them to create meaningful change to live the life you prefer.





            I have experience working with people who struggle with substance abuse and other addictions, suicidal thoughts, and mental illness, although I do not believe that you have to have a diagnosis in order to benefit from therapy. I also enjoy being an expert ear for someone who has a family member or loved one dealing with mental illness or addiction. If you are dealing with any of these issues, or simply want an affirming and non- judgemental therapist, give me a call!

        description: Elizabeth Galen, Ph.D., is a unique intuitive healer who combines her metaphysical skills with rigorous intellectual training and a life of challenging experiences to provide help for others facing difficult challenges in their own lives. As an intuitive healing coach, Elizabeth's work encompasses many different avenues and takes the form that each client needs whether it is talking, researching, connecting with higher powers, utilizing energy healing methods, or referring to practitioners with different solutions. Unifying her work is a belief that the mind, body and spirit are all one unit, and that in order to heal one, people have to heal them all. Clients come to Elizabeth for a variety of reasons. The common theme with these clients is that they are seeking to heal. The struggles they face may be physical, mental, emotional, relational, sexual or spiritual in origin. Elizabeth has particular experience working with those who endure stubborn health challenges such as Lyme disease, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivities, and many other chronic illnesses and conditions. Elizabeth has firsthand experience in healing from PTSD and C-PTSD in ways that are far gentler and more compassionate than those advocated by mainstream treatment. She also helps many who are looking to live "greener" lives without synthetic chemicals, who have suffered the death of a baby, or who simply want to approach their problems in different ways. In combining her wide range of skills, Elizabeth Galen helps clients discover new ways to heal when especially in cases when there seems to be little hope.

        description: Affirmation is crucial when we are working toward the life that we want to live. This is especially important in a culture that is still too often rejecting of LGBTQIA+ people. My training includes supervision focused on working in an affirming way with LGBTQIA+ people and I am committed to an ongoing process of understanding the unique needs of those whose sexuality and/or gender identity does not conform to "mainstream" society. I am a member of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (NCSF) and adhere to the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Standards of Care and the American Counseling Association (ACA) Competencies for Counseling LGBTQ+ Individuals. I provide individual and couple counseling to adults age 18 and over.

            I am an openly queer therapist working with individuals, couples, and consenting non-monogamy-poly relationships.  My affirming therapy approach supports individuals of diverse sexualities communities, including LGBTQ+ individuals, kink, BDSM, consensual non-monogamy, swingers, polyamory, and sex workers.   I work with those who experience anxiety, depression, intimacy, and sexual health-related challenges, or trauma.





            As an affirming therapist in San Diego, I wish to help you through the fear of being misunderstood, so we can get to the issues that are most pressing to you. My approach to therapy is through relational models such as Emotionally Focused Therapy and Gottman as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy.  Knowing yourself is the key to knowing why you behave and feel the way you do. Through self-exploration, you will develop better self-awareness. You will understand what elicits anxiety and what makes you feel happy and satisfied--where you identify your emotions and reactions to outside stressors.  Do not waste another minute being paralyzed by fear of not being heard or supported for the life you live.

            GG Wilbur provides a variety of services within the field of sexology.  I provide sexual education starting with the basics through advanced techniques and practices.  As a sex coach, I am trained in working with clients to identify and reach their goals in healthy forms of sexual expression.  I utilize the MEBES model that was developed by Dr. Patti Britton.





            The MEBES model is a holistic approach that employs the mind, emotions, body, energy, and spirit.  As a sexologist, I can provide sex coaching to resolve sexual issues and concerns.  Even if you have no sexual issues or concerns, my services can take you to higher levels of spiritual sexual enlightenment.





            Specialties





            My specialty areas are sacred sexuality and spiritual sexual enlightenment.  I utilize techniques based in Tantra, and Taoist teachings in working within spiritual sexuality.  I serve people in the Bi+, Pagan, BDSM, and Burning Man communities.





            The following are services that I provide:





            Spiritual Sexuality





            Sacred Sexuality and Sexual Enlightenment





            Body Image Healing





            Expanding sexual expression

            I focus on bi, pan, queer and poly clients of diverse and underserved backgrounds. For 15 years, bisexuality and consensual non-monogamy have been the structure, identity and study of my own relationships.  The intersections of our marginalized identities are valid and crucial to connecting more authentically with others. Let me empower you to gain a more intuitive understanding of yourself and your desires so that you can stand alone with confidence in your identity while also feeling the support of communities in which you belong. With practical interventions I can help move you towards creating more authentic connections.

        description: My approach to therapy is rooted in anti-oppression and liberatory principles, seeking to honor each person's individuality and autonomy. Much of my experience is working with people of color and queer and trans/gender non-conforming people. I have extensive training in trauma practice, particularly around experiences of abuse, violence, and intergenerational trauma. I draw from a variety of therapeutic techniques, including psychodynamic therapy, Sensorimotor Psychotherapy, Internal Family Systems, mindfulness, and other relational and somatic approaches. I am a queer, mixed-race Asian American of Uchinanchu and Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and my therapy space is warm and collaborative, fostering individuals' ability to build resilience, joy, and power.

I especially appreciate working with people who are looking for something different in their therapy experience and are wanting to explore in creative ways including through movement, art making, writing, and music. In sessions, I tend to offer immediate suggestions to deepen your process in order to make new insights into patterns and influences. I have experience working with people who have chronic pain/illness and/or cancer diagnoses as well as offering support to loved ones. I also recognize and incorporate the impact that social injustices and the severity of climate catastrophe has on mental and physical well-being.

I work with clients from diverse backgrounds and careers who are navigating a variety of challenges, including anxiety, depression, trauma, and identity development. To me, therapy is both an avenue for processing our personal struggles, and also part of combating the oppressive systems that undermine well-being. In that vain, as a queer cis white man, I strive to cultivate an antiracist and anti-oppressive practice. My work is informed by internal family systems (IFS), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and psychodynamic theory, but I will work with you collaboratively as we walk down this path together.

            I fully endorse that relationships heal and co-creating a liberated space where all bodies are comfortable is fundamental. I am committed to meeting clients where they are in the present moment and collaboratively working toward their goals. I have personal and professional experience with LGBT2QIA+, fat, and neurodivergent populations and can provide psychoeducation on neurodivergence and how to manage and embrace different minds. Although I tailor my approach to meet each client’s needs and style, I often draw connections across all types of relationships and interactions in the client’s life, as well as their mind-body connection to increase insight, reduce shame, and promote healthy relationships. I believe in supporting clients with anxiety by exploring the roots of unhelpful thoughts and exploring meaning that emotions are trying to communicate. I have many years of experience supporting emerging adults and LGBTQIA+ folx through the major transitions and anxieties, assisting with identity exploration and development, navigating different relationships, and identifying goals and hopes for the future.

            I currently offer remote individual and couple/relationship therapy for adults through Live Your Truth Counseling.

I specialize in working with trauma, anxiety and stress, chronic pain and illness, attention and executive functioning, identity exploration, and impacts of experiencing privilege and oppression.

            I am openly queer.

            I practice from an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) approach. This approach focuses on helping you learn to react differently to unwanted thoughts and feelings so that you can keep your focus on living a meaningful and fulfilling life based on what’s important to you

            Focus: My practice is 100% telehealth and I provide therapy with late teens and adults (of all ages). I specialize in working with LGBTQ+ clients. Other areas of focus include OCD, panic, depression, body-focused repetitive behaviors, and college student mental health.

            I am a Certified World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) Global Education Initiative Standards of Care 7 Member.

        description: "Starting therapy is brave. I aim to foster a relationship that is compassionate, free of judgment, and a place where you can express your truest thoughts and feelings. I believe that you are the expert on your own life, and the therapeutic space should be one that centers and honors your resiliency and strengths. Treatment is fluid and individualized uniquely for you. As such, I consider our work to be a co-created process and I endeavor to create a space where all expressions of selfhood and identity can be safely expressed. As a white, trans masc, nonbinary queer practitioner, my work is informed by my lived experience, motivated by personal connection to the communities I serve, and aspires to be as multi-dimensional as you are.\n\nI provide therapy to individuals, intimate partners, and families of all kind with an aspirational anti-oppressive, anti-racist, trauma-informed, harm reduction, and client-centered approach. My practice is firmly rooted in anti-oppression. I believe examining relationships of power and privilege is often central to healing and meaning-making. I use narrative therapy, IFS, relational, and psychodynamic approaches, as well as mindfulness, EMDR and somatic work in my practice. I also have specialized training and expertise working with people experiencing homelessness, struggling with substance use, experiencing anxiety and depression, and exploring their gender identities. I have extensive experience working with trauma and violence survivors, neuro-diverse clients, queer and TGNCNB+ people, HIV positive clients, immigrants, kink and D/S lifestyle relationships, sex workers, and polyamory/consensual non-monogamy, as well as many intersections of these lived experiences. \LI am also a Field Instructor through Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College in New York City.

            My goal as a therapist is to create a supportive environment for folks to explore their gender and sexuality. Maybe you identify as queer, bi, lesbian, gay, pan, ace, trans, nonbinary, agender, poly, kinky, something else, all of the above, or nothing at all. You deserve to have a space where you can learn more about the different parts of yourself without judgment or pressure. As a queer person who has sought out therapy myself, I know how challenging it can be to find an affirming therapist. Even if your identity isn’t central to your therapy goals, I will always aim to honor and validate every part of your identity in our work.

            My therapeutic style is collaborative and anti-oppressive. My approach is integrative, using tools across a variety of therapeutic modalities—relational, CBT, narrative, sex therapy—that are best suited to each unique client. In addition to specializing in identity, I support clients experiencing depression, anxiety, OCD, trauma, and relationship issues.

            My goal is to co-create a space with you that facilitates growth, emotional awareness, and authentic self-expression. Please reach out if you have any questions about my work or about therapy more generally. I'm glad that you're looking into getting the care you need right now, and I hope that we have the opportunity to connect more soon.

            My clinical work in session focuses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectic Behavioral Therapy (DBT), mindfulness, stress response awareness and relational restoration therapy.

            The majority of my clientele identify as LGBTQIA+ between the ages of 16-35, I have worked with older adults and younger youth as well. Common presenting symptoms include low mood, low motivation, panic, ruminating thoughts and dissociation. Issues that my clients typically deal with are related to independent living skills (budget, vocational, educational stressors), interpersonal skills (social anxiety, family of origin, immigration and cultural stressors), and self-esteem/self-confidence.

            Clients I work with tend to have experienced symptoms related to compound/complex trauma, depression, anxiety, which is frequently related to unconscious bias within mainstream expectations of cisgender, white, heteropatriarchy, able-bodied, financially privileged, capitalist culture.

            I'm a queer, radically sex-positive therapist who specializes in issues around sexuality, anxiety, and attachment difficulties. My approach honors how the mind-body-culture connection affects our relationships with ourselves and others. Drawing from modalities like psychosomatic therapy, internal family systems (IFS), and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), I gently push clients to engage with, and heal from, the scary stuff. I’m particularly passionate about helping survivors of sexual trauma get in touch with their bodies and sexuality in a way that feels safe and fulfilling.

            At the core of my practice is the belief that pleasure is a human right, and I’m here to guide clients toward the pleasure, rest, and joy that they deserve. I'm highly knowledgable about and affirming of sex work, kink, polyamory, queerness, neurodiversity, and fat liberation, among others. I’ve worked as a therapist to predominantly queer individuals and couples since 2022 and have several years’ experience in sexual violence intervention prior to that. I work with individuals, couples, polycules, and folks in all sorts of relationships. I also work with kids and teens to provide age-appropriate gender- and sexuality-affirming therapy. Some common concerns that folks see more for include: anxiety, OCD, existential life questions, gender and/or sexuality exploration, and healing from trauma (sexual, religious, relational, family, or other).

            Whether you are simply looking for an LGBTQ+ affirming therapist, or you are specifically seeking support on topics related to gender identity or sexual orientation, I’m here for you!

             I enjoy working with clients around topics including identity exploration, intersecting identities, coming out, LGBTQ+ identity at school or in the workplace, navigating homophobia and transphobia, and the interplay of LGBTQ+ identity and family, cultural, and/or religious views in your life.

            I have worked extensively with LGBTQ+ clients over time – through my practice, as a high school social worker, and as an outpatient therapist in a community mental health clinic. During graduate school, I had a year-long field placement at Fenway Health, a large community health center in Boston that is focused on providing high-quality care for LGBTQ+ people, people living with HIV/AIDS, and the BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) community.

            Additional areas of specialty include grief, substance use, people who have experienced oppression, people who have experienced domestic violence, and musicians/performers/presenters facing performance-related anxiety. I also often work with clients seeking support related to depression, anxiety, isolation, stress, and a variety of life stressors and transitions.

            I graduated from the University of Michigan with my MSW in Interpersonal Practice and Mental Health in 2016. I am a Certified Advanced Alcohol and Drug Counselor. As a person in recovery from SUD and as a queer woman, I have a passion for working with addiction and with LGBTQ+ people. I create a safe space for even the most taboo topics. I am knowledgeable and affirming of people who identify as polyamorous, kinky, or are in other alternative lifestyles. I am a therapist who values honesty, integrity, and respect in every counseling experience. I am flexible and work hard to create an individualized counselling experience for you.

            I help LGBTQ+ clients explore who they are and what they value. They will learn positive coping skills to manage stress, mental illness, and addiction. My clients learn about their thinking and how to change it to be more positive. They learn what makes them happy and how to get it. My clients learn how to manage conflict and to make boundaries with others.

            I have felt alone. I know what it feels like to be judged. If you are looking for someone who will care about you unconditionally, look no further. Flexible and patient, I welcome feedback from my clients. I do the right thing no matter what. I go above and beyond to create a personalized experience for my clients. I will bring out the best version of you!

            I only see clients (18 and up) virtually with HIPPA-compliant Google Meet software so I can see anyone in Michigan.

            I am LGBTQIAP2+, GNC/NB, SW, Kink/BDSM, and CNM/Poly/RA affirming and competent and use a collaborative approach to build a genuine working relationship with clients. In my current work I draw from a variety of methodologies and techniques, including Narrative Therapy, Feminist Theory, Person Centered Therapy, Psychodynamic Theory, mindfulness, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to support those who are looking to increase awareness about needs and desires or are seeking deeper meaning and satisfaction in their lives and relationships.

            I believe in the transformative power of human sexuality, intimacy and touch and work within a relational, trauma-informed, pleasure-oriented, anti-racist, anti-oppressive, sex positive and intersectional framework. I strive to cultivate a safe space to discuss and normalize the vastness of human sexuality and sexual expression. During our work together, we will safely explore fears, concerns, shame and desires, and identify areas you would like to focus on in order to gain further understanding of yourself and bring about desired change.

            I work with folks of all ages, particularly around concerns related to sexuality, gender, identity, desire, orgasm, anxiety, depression, life transitions, relationships, dating and trauma.

            Specializing in Queer Poly friendly kink aware psychotherapy with BIPOC clients. Ages 18-60

            As a proud second-generation Latinx person, I understand the importance of respecting your unique intersectionality and the desperate need to decolonize psychotherapy. Therefore, I offer a space for you to safely explore cognitive and relationship patterns with a well-trained, empathic, affirming person of color. I may be a person of color trained in some of the top educational institutions, but I have never lost sight of the complex challenges we have and continue to face daily in our society. Together, we can explore the beauty and power of the unique intersectionality we each experience. So, contact me, and we can discuss the next steps.

            I look forward to speaking.

I approach my clients with warmth, honesty, and humor to guide them in the conversations that are important to realizing their hopes and desires. I have experience working with a variety of non-traditional relationship structures such as polyam groups, open relationships, triadic relations, and other forms of consensual non-monogamy and BDSM dynamics. \n\nAs a gay therapist, I am a proud member of LGBTQ community and have experience working with people from many walks of life within the spectrums of Gender, Sexual, and Relationship Diversity (GSRD). I believe in my clients and aim to be a thoughtful and encouraging influence for them to discover, develop, and trust their innate power, abilities, and sense of self. You are the expert and author of your life. We can work together, using a narrative therapy approach, to better clarify how you would like your story to be understood while celebrating your skills and successes along the way.\n\nFocus: Adult Individuals, Seniors, Couples/Relationships\n\nSpecializations:\n- Gay Therapist\n- Gender Therapist\n- LGBTQ-Friendly Therapy\n- Sex Positive Therapist\n- Sexual Health\n- Sex Therapy\n- Sexual Functioning\n\n*Please note: I am active in the local community and occasionally attend local social events. So if you also attend local community events, we may know many of the same people. If this is an issue, please let me know upfront and I will do my best to provide with a more appropriate referral for you."

I see clients of all identities, and I specialize in the care and unique needs of queer, kinky, and nonmonogamous people, as well as those with a background in sex work. I am skilled in helping clients navigate issues related to gender identity, sexuality, and alternative relationship structures, life transitions, grief, anxiety, depression, and attachment ruptures. My work in general psychotherapy and sex therapy is trauma-informed and driven by principles of consent. I will meet you where you are on your journey in a non-judgmental and compassionate way. My practice is guided by values of anti-oppression, and I actively consider the impact of positionality and power dynamics throughout my life.\n \nI am a graduate of the Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College, with a specialized field of practice certificate in Gender and Sexuality. Before becoming a therapist, I spent 12 years working in theatre; as such, I integrate my experience working in artist care into my practice as a holistic-thinking clinician.\n \nI see adult clients on an individual basis, and in relationship structures of two or more. Our work together focuses on utilizing our mutual insight to discover and give voice to patterns and connections. I firmly believe that you are the expert of your own experiences, and that my role as a therapist is to use my clinical presence to help us both understand you better. I offer remote sessions as well as in-person sessions in lower Manhattan. I am looking forward to hearing from you!"

            Bio:

            I am a Black, queer, disabled, neurodivergent, non-binary therapist working with adult individuals and couples. I approach therapy as a team effort grounded in trauma-informed, anti-racist, fat liberatory, sex & kink positive, and feminist ideals. My therapy practice, while primarily based in Relational-Cultural Therapy, is eclectic, borrowing from multiple modalities in order to find the best approach for each individual client, couple, or polycule. Common approaches I incorporate include: EFT (emotion focused therapy), IFS (internal family systems), and Attachment Theory. When appropriate, I frequently like to incorporate exercises and homework to practice concrete skills and tools that are consistent with the stated goals. I prioritize working with communities with whom I share personal experience, including: LGBTQIA+, polyamorous/ENM, BDSM/kink, sex worker, SA/DV survivors, neurodivergent, chronically ill & disabled. I am not panelled in-network with any insurance plans, but can provide superbills for those with out of network benefits. My full fee is $300 and I offer sliding scale options based on need.

            Longer Script:

            When you make the decision to attend therapy, you are making the decision to prioritize your wellbeing in a fundamentally unique way. Therapy is something that can be challenging, but also transformative– Especially for those who have not been listened to, believed, or had the freedom to pause and practice introspection due to the demands of life.

            Knowing the challenges of finding a therapist who can understand your life experiences, I prioritize working with communities with whom I share personal experience. This includes, but is not limited to: LGBTQIA+, polyamorous/ENM, BDSM/kink, sex worker, SA/DV survivors, neurodivergent, chronically ill & disabled communities.

            My work is grounded in Relational-Cultural Therapy, which emphasizes the importance of the relationship between therapist and client as an essential part of the therapeutic process. I aim to minimize power dynamics in the room between therapist and client, and firmly believe you are the expert of your life. Rather than an authority in the room, I see my role as a collaborator in helping you achieve your therapy goals. For those who wish to know my social location: I am a Black, queer, disabled, neurodivergent, polyamorous, non-binary therapist in my 30s. I come from a middle-class background in a mixed race household, am a US citizen, and was raised Catholic but am not religious.

            I approach therapy as a team effort grounded in trauma-informed, anti-racist, fat liberatory, sex & kink positive, and feminist ideals. My therapy practice is eclectic, borrowing from multiple modalities in order to find the best approach for each individual client, couple, or polycule. Common approaches I incorporate include: EFT (emotion focused therapy), IFS (internal family systems), Sex Therapy, and Attachment Theory.

            I work with clients on a variety of topics, but special interests include: Unpacking attachment wounds using IFS; Transition stages in Poly/ENM; Freedom from shame regarding sex & kink; Impacts of disability; Relationships to health, disordered eating, and/or fatness from a fat liberatory and body neutrality lens.

            I am Jessy, a non-binary and queer professional dedicated to providing compassionate and affirming care for all LGBTQ+ individuals. Fluent in both Chinese and English, I specialize in supporting diverse clients, particularly those who are BIPOC. My journey navigating my own identity and relationships, along with my background as a former sex worker, has given me a deep understanding of the unique challenges faced within these communities.

            In my practice, I offer specialized services tailored to LGBTQ+ individuals, including kink-affirming and trans-affirming care, as well as support for ENM relationships. My therapeutic approach blends techniques such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), mindfulness, somatic work, Gestalt therapy, Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), and Internal Family Systems (IFS). As a longtime practitioner of the Alexander Technique, I incorporate somatic methods to help clients reconnect with and understand their bodies on a deeper level.

            Currently, I am training to become a licensed sex therapist, with a focus on guiding clients through gender and sexuality exploration and addressing issues related to sex and sexual trauma. Whether you are seeking support for anxiety, depression, trauma, relationship difficulties, or navigating complex issues related to gender and sexuality, I am here to walk alongside you on your journey toward healing and self-discovery. My collaborative approach ensures that your voice is heard and valued, and together, we can work towards achieving your personal and therapeutic goals.

            As a bilingual therapist fluent in both Chinese and English, I am uniquely positioned to provide culturally competent care to Chinese-speaking clients. This includes navigating issues related to immigration, acculturation, and the intersection of cultural identity with gender and sexuality.

            My rich background in theater, film, visual design, music, creative writing, dance, and singing allows me to integrate creative and artistic elements into my therapeutic work. This artistic integration is especially beneficial for clients who find it challenging to articulate their feelings through words alone. By incorporating these creative and nonverbal avenues for self-expression, I aim to offer a holistic approach to healing.

            I am continuously involved in further education and professional development to enhance my competence in LGBTQ+ care. Iregularly attend conferences, workshops, and training sessions to stay updated on the latest mental health care practices for these communities, ensuring that I offer informed and effective care.

        description: I believe in community care, growth, liberation, joy, resilience, justice, and healing. My approach is rooted in liberation, relational, and psychodynamic work through anti-oppressive and social justice lenses, and includes modalities such as narrative therapy, somatic work, and mindfulness. I am passionate about working with intersectional identities of race, gender, sexuality, and neurodivergence and focus around issues of relationships, polyamory/non-monogamy, kink/BDSM/Leather, grief and loss, life transitions, and trauma.

        description: Online counselling sessions for adults using the person centred approach. I am especially passionate about supporting people who are struggling with issues relating to their identity. Some examples of this could be due to trying to figure out their identity, develop more self acceptance, or navigating a change in their sense of self after a breakup or other life transition. I work in English with anyone aged 18 or over. Each session lasts for 50 minutes.

            As a stereotypical bisexual myself, I'm familiar with many of the unique challenges we face, especially in the current political climate. Whether you're struggling with anxiety or sadness, identity confusion or lack of confidence, feeling "not gay enough", religious trauma or abandonment, concerns with sex or relationship problems - I'm eager to help. Therapy can be intimidating, so I use a laid-back, collaborative approach to help you achieve your goals, leading to positive change for you and your loved ones. I really connect with older teens and young to middle-aged adults, primarily women and nonbinary folks who are seeking validation and safety while they improve their mental health.

            This is a safe space for those in the LGBTQIA+ community, as well as those from all ethnicities and walks of life.

            I love working with folks who are looking for a direct but laidback and collaborative therapist and who are ready to face their feelings and seek change, even if they’re unsure how to start. I know you're brave enough to reach out and eager to grow - so send me a text or email! Let's get started :)

            I offer online telehealth counseling sessions to clients anywhere in California.

        description: "Professional specialties and skills:\n\nI offer a comprehensive range of services, including Psychodynamic Counselling and Psychotherapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Psychosexual Therapy, Relationship Therapy, and Couples Therapy. I also provide Gender, Sexuality, and Relationship Diverse (GSRD) Therapy, all tailored to meet your unique needs.\n\nBrief Psychodynamic Therapy\n \nThis approach focuses on unconscious processes and how they manifest in current behaviours, helping clients gain self-awareness and understand the impact of past experiences on present actions. It aims to uncover unresolved conflicts and patterns from dysfunctional relationships that may contribute to emotional distress or issues like substance abuse.\n\nSessions are structured around a central focus, agreed upon early in therapy, allowing for a targeted approach. Typically lasting 20 to 25 sessions, this therapy aims to address key concerns efficiently, with ongoing evaluation to determine the need for further work.\n\nPsychodynamic Psychotherapy\n \nPsychodynamic Psychotherapy, also known as insight-oriented therapy, focuses on the unconscious processes that shape present behaviour. The goal is to increase self-awareness and understand how past experiences influence current actions. Through this approach, clients can explore unresolved conflicts and symptoms stemming from dysfunctional past relationships.\n\nIn long-term therapy, which typically spans at least two years, the process fosters deeper emotional development and helps clients address core aspects of identity and personality. A strong therapeutic alliance is essential, encouraging open self-disclosure and empathetic support from the therapist, allowing for meaningful change over time.\n\nCognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT)\n\nCognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is a structured, goal-oriented talking therapy designed to help you manage problems by altering the way you think and behave. It is particularly effective in addressing specific mental health conditions and is both \"problem-focused\" and \"action-oriented.\"\n\nCBT operates on the principle that thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and behaviours are interconnected. Negative thought patterns can trap individuals in a cycle of distress, and CBT helps break this cycle by challenging and transforming unhelpful cognitive distortions (such as beliefs and attitudes) and maladaptive behaviours.\n\nThe therapy emphasises improving emotional regulation and developing practical coping strategies to address current issues. CBT is grounded in the belief that by changing thought distortions and behaviours, distress and psychological symptoms can be significantly reduced, empowering clients to regain control over their mental health.\n\nGender, Sexuality & Relationship Diverse (GSRD) Therapy  \n \nGender, Sexuality & Relationship Diverse (GSRD) Therapy is an inclusive therapeutic approach that supports clients from a wide spectrum of identities and relationships, extending beyond the LGBTQ+ community to include individuals who identify as intersex, non-binary, asexual, kink, non-monogamous, and more. This therapy recognises the unique experiences, challenges, and concerns of GSRD individuals, such as facing discrimination, trauma from past medical procedures, or internalised and external phobias related to their identity.\n\nIn GSRD Therapy, I offer a safe and non-judgmental space where clients can explore their gender, sexuality, or relationship structures without fear of pathologization. I have specialised training from organizations like Pink Therapy and Gendered Intelligence (GI), along with experience working in GSRD-focused settings. My approach is to meet clients at their pace, addressing specific issues they wish to explore, while acknowledging that these topics may not always be central to their therapy.\n\nAs a GSRD rights advocate and campaigner for the ban on conversion therapy, I aim to create a therapeutic environment where clients feel understood and respected in their identities. Whether you are exploring issues related to gender and sexuality or other aspects of life, such as grief, anxiety, or work-related stress, I provide a supportive and informed perspective.\n\nMy practice is open to clients from all backgrounds, including heterosexual and monogamous individuals, with the goal of providing a space where everyone feels heard and valued. My pronouns are \"he,\" \"him,\" and \"his.\"\n\nNeurodivergent-Affirmative Therapy\n\nAt my Private Practice, I understand that neurodivergence is part of the diverse ways people think, feel, and process the world around them. I approach neurodivergence with respect and empathy, acknowledging that it brings both unique strengths and distinct challenges.\n\n My Neurodivergent-Affirmative Therapy is tailored to meet these complexities, ensuring that neurodivergent individuals feel seen, heard, and supported in their personal, familial, and relational dynamics.\n\n​I offer Neurodivergent-Affirmative Counselling and psychotherapy both in person and online through different locations across London.\n\nPsychosexual and Sex Therapy\n​\nPsychosexual and Sex Therapy addresses sexual and intimate relationship concerns, offering support for individuals or couples facing challenges in their sexual lives. These challenges may range from psychological issues to physical factors or a combination of both, and they can cause distress and dissatisfaction.\n\nIn therapy, I provide a safe, confidential, and non-judgmental space to explore various issues related to sexuality and relationships. My approach is tailored to the unique needs of each client, with a focus on emotional concerns, relationship dynamics, and practical interventions. Together, we work on identifying your therapeutic goals, and I offer insights and customised strategies to help you reclaim or establish a fulfilling and satisfying sexual life.\n\nIntimate Partners Therapy (IPT) or Couples Therapy\n​\nIn Intimate Partners Therapy (IPT), the focus is on fostering constructive communication, strengthening emotional bonds, and addressing relational challenges between partners. The aim is to create a safe, neutral space where both partners can express their thoughts and feelings openly, knowing that their perspectives will be heard and understood without judgement.\n\nI adhere to the ethical standards set by the BACP, BPC and COSRT and I am fully DBS-checked.\n\nLanguage(s) spoken: English and Brazilian Portuguese\n\nPopulations served - all adult ages, LGBTQ+, Neurodivergent clients"

            As someone who is a survivor and grew up queer and neurodivergent in a small conservative town, I understand the importance of having a safe space where you can explore all of the different facets of yourself. My goal is to co-create an environment with you where you feel empowered to show up authentically, to explore, nurture, and hold every facet of your identity with compassion.

            Are you constantly feeling overwhelmed, burnt out, or just trying to make it through the day? Are you wanting a space where you can explore sexuality, identity, gender, and kink without feeling shamed? Maybe you’re struggling with reconnecting to your body and mind after sexual/relational trauma.

            I take a person-centered, relational approach to therapy, cultivating a space where we can work together to bring more ease, joy, and self-connection into your life.

            Special focus on:
            - Queer, trans, and neurodivergent folks
            - Somatic and mindfulness based work, IFS, and neurodivergent-affirming CBT
            - Healing from sexual trauma and CPTSD
            - Couples and polycules navigating relationship challenges and communication barriers
            - Folks navigating grief and loss

            Growth and healing happen when we create space for all parts of ourselves to be witnessed and held. In our work together, I'll help you develop a compassionate relationship with your inner world while working with you to develop skills and understanding to navigate life's complexities with greater ease and authenticity.

            I am dedicated to creating a safe, affirming, and nonjudgmental space for clients across the spectrum of gender and sexuality.

            I believe the client-therapist relationship is at the heart of the therapeutic process, and I strive to collaboratively co-create meaning and a greater understanding of yourself. I draw on psychodynamic, relational, narrative, and structural modalities to build a working relationship that is unique to each client and their needs.

            My goal as a therapist is to create a supportive environment for folks to explore their gender and sexuality. Maybe you identify as queer, bi, lesbian, gay, pan, ace, trans, nonbinary, agender, poly, kinky, something else, all of the above, or nothing at all. You deserve to have a space where you can learn more about the different parts of yourself without judgment or pressure. As a queer person who has sought out therapy myself, I know how challenging it can be to find an affirming therapist. Even if your identity isn’t central to your therapy goals, I will always aim to honor and validate every part of your identity in our work.

            My therapeutic style is collaborative and anti-oppressive. My approach is integrative, using tools across a variety of therapeutic modalities—relational, CBT, narrative, sex therapy—that are best suited to each unique client. In addition to specializing in identity, I support clients experiencing depression, anxiety, OCD, trauma, and relationship issues.

            My goal is to co-create a space with you that facilitates growth, emotional awareness, and authentic self-expression. Please reach out if you have any questions about my work or about therapy more generally. I'm glad that you're looking into getting the care you need right now, and I hope that we have the opportunity to connect more soon.
